Welcome to JustFLAC
===================

What's the heck?
----------------

It isn't a fish, it is just a fork of popular
jFLAC decoder. 

Why to fork?
------------

jFLAC is out of support and seemed missed certain
popular formats as 24 bits/192,000. The decoder has
also few minor bugs. So the project is supposed
to give new format extension support and also fix
some bugs.

It is already used in MediaChest and Music-Barrel giving life 
audiophile quality formats previously supported only by Foobar and
DeaDBeeF. By the fomers are C programs when newly supported are java.
